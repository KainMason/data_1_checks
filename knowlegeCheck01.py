"""To complete the first knowledge check, do the following:

Create a GitHub repo called "data_1_checks". You will upload ALL knowledge checks to this repo in the future.
Send that link to your mentor so they can check it when you finish the assignment.
Make a .py (or .ipynb) file that contains the following (your choice of editor does not matter!):
a statement that prints "hello world!"
a list populated with several values. They can be strings / integers / floats etc. Then, print() one of those values either to the prompt or in a cell (if using Jupyter Notebook)
a dictionary populated with two keys and two values. Print one of the values just like you did above.
a tuple with 4 values. Print one of them.
Commit your changes.
Push your changes to your repo and notify your mentor!"""
